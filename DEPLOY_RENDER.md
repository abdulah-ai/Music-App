# Deploy Duskglen on Render

Render is the best free fit for this project because the backend is FastAPI and
the frontend can export to static web files.

## 1. Push the repo

Create a GitHub repository that contains this whole folder:

```text
SuperMediaApp/
  render.yaml
  backend/
  frontend/
```

Do not commit local secrets, databases, media, or build output. The root
`.gitignore` is already set up for that.

## 2. Deploy with Render Blueprint

1. Open Render.
2. Choose **New > Blueprint**.
3. Connect the GitHub repo.
4. Pick the repo root containing `render.yaml`.
5. Deploy.

Render will create:

- `supermediaapp-api`
- `supermediaapp-web`

## 3. Set frontend API URL

After `supermediaapp-api` gets its URL, set this environment variable on
`supermediaapp-web`:

```text
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://supermediaapp-api.onrender.com
```

Then redeploy the frontend.

## 4. Optional public registration gate

To avoid random people using your downloader and storage:

Backend env:

```text
SMA_REGISTRATION_INVITE_CODE=choose-a-private-code
```

Frontend env:

```text
EXPO_PUBLIC_REGISTRATION_INVITE_REQUIRED=true
```

Then redeploy both services.

## 5. YouTube bot-check cookies

Cloud IPs are often challenged by YouTube. If downloads fail with "Sign in to
confirm you're not a bot", set a cookie secret on the Render Docker web
service.

Recommended export flow:

1. Open a private/incognito browser window.
2. Sign into YouTube in that private window.
3. In the same tab, open `https://www.youtube.com/robots.txt`.
4. Export only `youtube.com` cookies as a Netscape `cookies.txt` file.
5. Close the private window and do not reopen that session.

Then paste the full contents of `cookies.txt` into this Render environment
variable:

```text
SMA_YTDLP_COOKIES_TEXT=# Netscape HTTP Cookie File
...
```

Alternative base64 flow:

```text
SMA_YTDLP_COOKIES_B64=paste-base64-cookies-here
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("C:\path\to\cookies.txt")) | Set-Clipboard
```

After setting the variable, redeploy. Cookies are private account credentials:
do not commit them to GitHub and refresh them if YouTube starts challenging
downloads again.

The Docker image also installs yt-dlp's current default YouTube helpers,
Chrome request impersonation support, and Node 22 for YouTube JavaScript
challenges. If cookies are fresh but YouTube still rejects the Render IP, set
`SMA_YTDLP_PROXY_URL` to a clean residential/ISP proxy and redeploy.

## Free-tier warning

Render free web services do not keep local filesystem changes permanently.
SQLite data and downloaded media may disappear after restarts or redeploys.
For real long-term use, upgrade to a paid Render service with a disk, or move
the database/storage to managed services.
