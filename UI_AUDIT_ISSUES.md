# Star Hollow UI Audit — Live Issue List

Working list from a screenshot-by-screenshot pass over the app (mobile-first,
current build). Each issue has a description, and where useful, a suggested
direction. Completed work is recorded inline with a bold status so this file
remains the source of truth for both the original report and its resolution.

Keep the existing dark Star Hollow identity (navy night sky, frosted glass
surfaces, forest accents) while fixing these — none of this should turn into
a broader redesign. Fix issues independently where possible; don't bundle
unrelated changes into one commit.

---

## Issue 1 — Bottom tab bar is always pinned and eats screen space

**Screen:** Mobile, every screen with the tab bar (Today, Library, Identify,
Activity).

**Problem:** The bottom tab bar (Today / Library / Identify / Activity) is
permanently visible and takes up a fixed strip of the viewport at all times.

**Suggested fix:** Make it collapsible — either auto-hide on scroll down and
reappear on scroll up (a well-established mobile pattern), or give it an
explicit collapse affordance. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` /
`AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()` for the hide/show transition,
consistent with how `SanctuaryMode.tsx` and `Starwell.tsx` already gate their
animations.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

### Issue 1b — Content gets cut off behind the tab bar

**Screen:** Today (Offline shelf card at the bottom of the scroll).

**Problem:** The "Offline shelf" card's body text and icon are partially
hidden underneath the tab bar — insufficient bottom clearance on scrollable
content.

**Suggested fix:** This is a symptom of a recurring pattern (we've now hit it
on Library's multi-select bar, the Identify search bar, and here). Rather than
patching bottom padding screen-by-screen, define **one shared "safe bottom
inset" constant/hook** (there is already a `layout.dockClearance` /
`layout.tabBarClearance` token in `theme/theme.ts` — audit whether every
scrollable screen actually uses it, since this keeps recurring) and apply it
everywhere content can sit near the tab bar or mini player.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

---

## Issue 2 — Dashboard customize modal ("Arrange your hollow")

**Screen:** Today → dashboard settings icon → "Arrange your hollow" modal.

1. **Full-screen takeover for a settings panel.**
   Suggested fix: centered dialog/panel with a max-width and internal scroll
   instead of a full-bleed sheet. Can stay near-full-height on mobile if
   needed, but should read as a floating panel on desktop.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

2. **Reorder up/down arrow buttons look bland, low-affordance, and don't
   show disabled state at list boundaries** (first item's "up", last item's
   "down").
   Suggested fix: either a proper drag handle for drag-to-reorder, or keep
   arrows but give them a real disabled visual state and more contrast.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

3. **No real light/dark theme — "Forest Night" / "Cosmic Night" read as two
   near-identical dark variants**, not a genuine light/dark pair, and both
   use the same generic leaf icon rather than previewing their own accent.
   Suggested fix: make each accent option visually preview its own hue in the
   selector; if a real light mode is wanted, it needs its own token set (see
   "Broader suggestions" below).

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion** (accent previews; a true
   light theme remains an unscoped product decision.)

4. **Layout/Accent segmented controls feel generic** — selected state is a
   subtle background tint, easy to miss.
   Suggested fix: reuse the glass/glow selected-state treatment already built
   for `Button` and `IconButton` so selection is unmistakable.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

5. **Weak/no open-close animation.**
   Suggested fix: short scale+fade or slide-up transition using the existing
   `motion` duration/easing tokens in `theme/theme.ts` rather than new values.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

6. **Too dense** — every widget row repeats icon + title + subtitle + two
   arrow buttons + a toggle for 8 rows.
   Suggested fix: simplify per-row chrome (see #2 — drag handle removes two
   buttons per row) and tighten row height.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

7. **Bottom tab bar bleeds through the modal** — "Listening stats" row is
   half-covered by the tab bar. Same root cause as Issue 1b; should resolve
   once this becomes a proper centered dialog (#1).

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

---

## Issue 3 — Sidebar needs a modernization pass

**Screen:** Desktop/tablet sidebar (`AppSidebar.tsx`).

1. **Visual design feels dated/flat** — wants a more modern look overall
   (this one is subjective; needs a design pass, not just a token swap — the
   glass surface language from the recent dashboard work is the natural
   direction here since the sidebar currently doesn't use it).

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

2. **No animations** on nav item selection, hover, or expand/collapse.
   Suggested fix: subtle transition on the active-row accent bar and
   background tint (reuse `motion` tokens), plus a hover micro-interaction.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

3. **No "Add account" option** — the account row at the bottom only supports
   a single signed-in user with sign-out; no multi-account switching.
   Suggested fix: needs product scoping first (does this mean multiple
   Star Hollow accounts on one device, switchable without re-entering a
   password each time? That's a real feature, not a small UI tweak — token
   storage, cached-user data, and Issue 4 below all need to support multiple
   concurrent identities before "Add account" can work correctly).
4. **Telegram connection isn't remembered** — user has to reconnect
   repeatedly instead of staying linked.
   Suggested fix: needs verification before fixing. The backend already
   tracks link status per account (`TelegramScreen.tsx` checks
   `status.authorized` on load and jumps straight to the `'linked'` phase if
   true, and there's a `telegram_account` model on the backend), so on paper
   this should already persist. Reproduce exactly when it re-prompts
   (different device? after logout/login? after some time period?) before
   assuming the fix — it may turn out to be entangled with Issue 4's account
   state bleed rather than a Telegram-specific bug.

---

## Issue 4 — Cross-account data leak: playback/library state isn't cleared on account switch (bug, not cosmetic)

**Screen:** Any screen, after signing out of one account and into another.

**Problem:** Confirmed directly in the code, not just from a screenshot.
`authStore.logout()` (`frontend/src/store/authStore.ts:77-81`) only clears
`tokenStorage` and `offlineMedia` — it never resets `usePlayerStore`,
`useLibraryStore`, `useDashboardStore`, `usePinStore`, `usePlayHistoryStore`,
`useFavoritesStore`, `usePlaylistStore`, or `useScanHistoryStore`. These are
all global Zustand stores that live for the app process's lifetime, so
switching accounts leaves account A's now-playing track (and library, pins,
play history, etc.) visible to account B until a full page reload.

**Suggested fix:** Add a single "reset all session-scoped stores" call
invoked from `logout()` (and again right after a successful `login()`/
`register()`, in case something was left over from an unclean previous
session) that clears every store above back to its initial state. Since this
is a correctness/privacy bug — one account's data being visible to another —
treat it as higher priority than the cosmetic issues above, and fix before
"Add account" (Issue 3.3) is built, since multi-account support would make
this bug worse, not better, if the underlying stores still aren't isolated
per identity.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-correctness**

---

## Issue 5 — Library card polish (grid + list view)

**Screen:** Library, both grid and list layouts.

1. **Square glow artifact behind the round play button on hover — confirmed
   root cause.** In `frontend/src/components/library/LibraryMediaView.tsx`,
   the hover glow (`shadowColor`/`shadowRadius`/`shadowOffset`) is applied to
   `playFabWrap`, a plain rectangular `View` with no `borderRadius` — the
   pill shape only exists on the inner `LinearGradient` (`playFab`,
   `borderRadius: radii.pill`). On React Native Web a shadow on an unrounded
   box renders as a square glow, which is exactly the square visible behind
   the circular play button.
   Suggested fix: move `borderRadius: radii.pill` onto `playFabWrap` itself
   (or otherwise wrap the shadow around an already-rounded element).

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-correctness**

2. **Blank/black fallback thumbnails — confirmed root cause.** Tracks with no
   real artwork fall back to a dark `coverGradient` plus a glyph icon
   rendered at only `0x59` (~35%) opacity (`LibraryMediaView.tsx`, glyph
   fallback block). Against the already-dark fallback gradient, the glyph is
   nearly invisible, so the card reads as a plain black square instead of a
   recognizable "no artwork" placeholder.
   Suggested fix: raise the glyph's fallback contrast substantially, or use a
   solid tinted background instead of relying on a faint icon alone, so a
   missing-artwork card still looks intentional.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

3. **Raw scraped titles again** — e.g. "Take It Off – Kesha #kesha
   #lyrics_songs #lyricsedit #…" and "Children – Robert Miles (Intermediate
   Piano Tutorial)" dump source-site metadata straight into the display
   title, then get awkwardly truncated mid-word/mid-hashtag. Same underlying
   issue flagged from the first screenshot (Home's "Continue listening"
   card) — confirms this is systemic, not a one-off, and should be fixed
   once in `displayTitle` rather than per-screen.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

4. **No animations** — grid↔list view toggle snaps instantly; cards have no
   entrance transition and only the play button fades on hover.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

5. **General "friendliness" gaps:**
   - The yellow status dot on a card has no visible label/tooltip explaining
     what it means.
   - Grid and list cards currently show wildly inconsistent visual quality
     (one has a real, readable thumbnail; the other is a near-blank square)
     — reads as broken/unfinished rather than "no artwork available."

   **Status: needs clarification** — the current card implementation has no
   yellow status dot to label; a screenshot or its intended meaning is needed
   before adding or changing one. The artwork-quality portion is fixed by
   Issue 5.2's shared fallback.

---

## Issue 6 — Video player experience

**Screen:** Fullscreen video player (`GlobalVideoStage.tsx`), and its
minimized/floating state seen over the Library screen.

1. **General dissatisfaction with the video display** — wants an overall
   better/more polished layout for the fullscreen player. No specific
   sub-complaint beyond "I don't like how the video displayed" — needs a
   concrete design direction before implementation.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-open-items** — the expanded player now
   uses a responsive cinema stage, poster-derived night ambience, and one
   coherent frosted-glass chrome hierarchy while retaining native controls.

2. **Wants next/prev to visibly swap the video content, not just audio.**
   Needs verification before assuming it's broken: `GlobalVideoStage.tsx`
   already builds a `videoQueue` from the library's video items and wires
   `nextMedia`/`prevMedia`/`setMediaId`, so switching *should* already swap
   the rendered video. This screenshot's library has only one video (see the
   "VIDEO 1 OF 1" badge), so next/prev are correctly inert here — **retest
   with 2+ videos in the library** before treating this as a bug rather than
   a test-data limitation.

   **Status: resolved by verification in codex/ui-audit-completion** — with
   two local video fixtures, Next changed the rendered title and badge from
   video 1 of 2 to video 2 of 2.

3. **Wants controls to auto-hide behind a blur after 3–5 seconds of
   inactivity, so the video is unobstructed** (any tap brings them back).
   Confirmed this doesn't exist yet — there is no `setTimeout`/
   `controlsVisible`-style logic anywhere in `GlobalVideoStage.tsx`; every
   control (top bar, transport bar, track info) stays permanently visible.
   This is a net-new feature, not a fix.
   Suggested direction: fade + slight blur of the chrome layer after N
   seconds idle, restore instantly on any interaction — the same pattern
   most video apps use (YouTube, Netflix).

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

4. **Dislikes the minimized/floating video window** overlapping other
   screens — seen in the second screenshot, where a small floating video
   card sits on top of the Library list, obscuring the Favorites tab and
   filter row underneath. This is a deliberate existing feature
   (`mode: 'mini'` in `videoPlayerStore.ts` — a persistent draggable
   picture-in-picture window so video minimizes like audio does), but the
   user wants it removed or redesigned into something less intrusive.
   Suggested direction: needs a product decision among: (a) remove PiP
   entirely and just pause/stop video on leaving the player, (b) keep it but
   constrain it to never overlap primary content (fixed corner dock, correct
   z-index, smaller size), or (c) replace it with a persistent strip matching
   the audio mini-player's pattern instead of a floating card.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-open-items** — option (c) implemented as
   a fixed frosted mini-video strip sharing the audio player's dock, safe-area,
   desktop-rail, and contextual bottom-bar clearance behavior.

---

## Issue 7 — Track options menu ("…") covers the whole screen

**Screen:** Library, tapping "…" on any track.

**Problem:** Opens a near-full-height bottom sheet (Play, Play next, Add to
queue, Add to favorites, Pin for quick access, Add to playlist, More by
artist, Rename/edit details, Select multiple, Save file, Delete) that
dominates the screen — the same "full takeover for what should be a small
menu" pattern as the dashboard modal (Issue 2.1).

**Suggested fix:** Shrink into a compact, glass/blur-styled floating menu
using the frosted-glass surface language already built this session
(`GlassPanel`/`glass` tokens in `theme/theme.ts`), anchored near where it was
triggered — not a heavy opaque full-height sheet.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

---

## Issue 8 — Selection-mode bottom bar overlaps the tab bar — confirmed root cause, and it's an incomplete fix of a bug we already fixed once

**Screen:** Library, select mode (tap "Select multiple…" then select items).

**Problem:** Confirmed directly in the code. In
`frontend/src/screens/LibraryScreen.tsx`, the bulk-selection bar (`bulkBar`,
~line 662) only pads for the device safe-area:
`paddingBottom: insets.bottom + spacing.sm`. It never accounts for the
persistent mobile tab bar's own height (`layout.tabBarClearance` /
`dockClearance` in `theme/theme.ts`), so on mobile it renders flush at the
screen's bottom edge, directly under the Today/Library/Identify/Activity bar
— cutting off the "N selected" label and the Delete button.

**This is the same interaction already fixed once this session** — the mini
player was moved above the bulk bar via `bulkBarOffset` →
`MiniPlayerBar bottomOffset`. That handled the mini-player collision
correctly but never accounted for the tab bar itself, so this is an
incomplete fix, not a new bug.

**Suggested fix:** Apply the same clearance treatment already used for the
mini player — pad `bulkBar` by the tab bar's height too, not just the
safe-area inset. This is the "systemic bottom-clearance" issue already
flagged in Broader Suggestions below; this is now the **third** confirmed
occurrence (Issue 1b, Issue 2.7, and this one).

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-correctness**

### Issue 8b — Selection display consistency for video items (needs clarification)

**Problem (as reported, needs confirmation):** the selected-item visual
treatment may need polishing, and the same problem may occur when selecting
a video item specifically, not just other media types.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-open-items** — the video fixture exposed a
real grid collision: the duration/type badge and selection check occupied the
same corner. Selection now hides that badge, exposes selected state to assistive
technology, and uses the same no-layout-shift glass treatment in grid/list.

---

## Issue 9 — Player screen (Now Playing) — highest priority per the user

**Screen:** `PlayerScreen.tsx`, the full Now Playing view.

**User's framing:** "the most important page in the whole app... what gives
a feeling of listening to music." Wants a real visual/animation upgrade, not
a small tweak. **Prioritize this above the smaller polish items once fixes
start.**

1. **General visual/animation upgrade** — open-ended, wants a stronger
   "listening to music" feeling and more motion throughout. No concrete
   sub-items yet; needs a design direction agreed before implementation.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-open-items**

2. **Transport play/pause button — confirmed root cause, third occurrence of
   the accent-contrast bug.** `PlayerScreen.tsx:236` sets the big center
   button's `backgroundColor: accent` directly, using the same
   `useTrackAccent()` hook (`hooks/useTrackAccent.ts`) already implicated in
   the mini-player and Home resume-button contrast failures from the very
   first screenshot reviewed. For this track's warm-toned artwork, it
   renders as a near-invisible dark maroon circle on this screen too.
   Confirms this is **one systemic bug** — an unclamped track-derived color
   used as a solid fill with no minimum contrast floor — not three separate
   incidents. Fix once, at the `useTrackAccent` level (clamp/adjust the
   derived color's luminance before using it as a button fill), not per
   button. See also the elevated note in Broader Suggestions below.

   **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

3. **"Sanctuary" pill looks disabled/inconsistent with the other three
   pills** (Up next, Lyrics, More look active-styled; Sanctuary looks
   visibly dimmed with no explanation).
   **Status: resolved by observation** — a follow-up screenshot shows
   Sanctuary Mode activates correctly; the pill just uses a coral/red tint
   for its active state instead of the teal used elsewhere in the app, which
   read as "dimmed." Not a bug — optionally worth aligning its accent color
   with the rest of the app for consistency, but no functional issue.

---

## Issue 13 — Sanctuary Mode's next/prev doesn't advance to another track (likely root cause found, needs confirmation)

**Screen:** Player screen → Sanctuary Mode, tapping next/prev.

**Problem:** Reported that Sanctuary Mode — described as an ambient
"put the phone down and just listen" screensaver-like state — doesn't
advance to a different track when using its next/prev controls.

**Likely root cause:** Traced a real, plausible pathway in
`frontend/src/store/playerStore.ts:154` — the queue's auto-continuation
logic explicitly filters to `media_type === 'audio'` only when pulling more
tracks in from the library:
`useLibraryStore.getState().items.filter((m) => m.media_type === 'audio' && ...)`.
The track in this screenshot ("Children – Robert Miles") is classified
`video`. If it ended up as the sole item in the queue, the continuation
logic that would normally extend the queue with more tracks explicitly
excludes video-type items — meaning there may genuinely be nothing for
`playNext()` to advance to.

**Needs confirmation:** does this reproduce with an audio-type track
playing instead of a video-type one? That would confirm the issue is
specifically about how video-classified media interacts with the
audio-only queue system, not Sanctuary Mode's next/prev controls
themselves being broken.

**Status: resolved by verification in codex/ui-audit-completion** — with two
audio tracks queued, Sanctuary's Previous moved to the other track and Next
moved back. The controls themselves are working; the reported case was the
single video-classified queue limitation described above.

---

## Issue 14 — Ambient starfield/aurora in Sanctuary Mode feels completely static and "empty" (likely root cause found)

**Screen:** Player screen → Sanctuary Mode background.

**Problem:** "There is no animation at all... it's just empty." The
starfield and aurora sweep in the screenshot show zero visible motion.

**Likely root cause:** `SanctuaryMode.tsx`'s star-twinkle and aurora-drift
animations are both explicitly gated by
`AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()` — if the device/browser used for
this screenshot has "reduce motion" enabled at the OS level, **both
animations are intentionally disabled entirely**, which would produce
exactly this frozen scene.

**Needs verification:** check whether reduce-motion is enabled on the
device/browser this was captured on. If it's off and the scene still looks
static, that's a separate, real animation bug.

**Separately, regardless of the above:** even with motion working, the
current design (a handful of small dots, one subtle aurora sweep) may be too
sparse to read as "alive" at a glance. Worth a genuine visual upgrade to
this scene on its own merits, since "empty" was the user's own word for it
— ties into Issue 9's broader ask for the Player experience to feel more
alive.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-open-items**

**Enhancement: upgraded in codex/forest-and-remaining-audit** — the geometric
aurora and polygon ridge were replaced by responsive, locally bundled
photorealistic night-forest assets. The same restrained forest environment now
continues behind the app shell and primary screens without weakening the glass
surface hierarchy or offline behavior.

---

## Issue 10 — Lyrics don't work — confirmed root cause, tied to the title-cleaning issue

**Screen:** Player screen → Lyrics tab.

**Problem:** Traced in `frontend/src/services/api/lyrics.ts`: it queries
lrclib.net using the raw `media.title`/`media.artist` fields as-is. For this
track, that's the scraped garbage title ("Children – Robert Miles
(Intermediate Piano Tutorial) #pianocover #…") and `capo.piano` as the
"artist" field — which is a YouTube channel name, not the real recording
artist. That search has almost no chance of matching anything in lrclib's
database.

**This is a second, functional consequence of the title-cleaning problem
already flagged in Issue 5.3** — cleaning up title/artist metadata wouldn't
just look better on cards, it would make lyrics actually work for tracks
that do exist in lrclib's database.

**Suggested fix:** Once `displayTitle`/artist cleanup exists (per Issue
5.3), use the cleaned values — not the raw scraped fields — when querying
lrclib. Also worth distinguishing "uploader/channel name" from "real artist"
in the data model if that distinction doesn't already exist, since
`capo.piano` (a channel) and `Robert Miles` (the actual artist) are very
different things for a lyrics/metadata lookup.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

---

## Issue 11 — "Up next" panel covers the full screen, mostly empty

**Screen:** Player screen → "Up next" pill.

**Problem:** Same full-takeover pattern as Issues 2.1 and 7 — and
especially wasteful here: with one track in the library, the sheet shows one
row of content on top of a large empty void.

**Suggested fix:** Same as Issue 7 — compact, glass/blur-styled panel sized
to its content, not a fixed full-height sheet.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

---

## Issue 12 — "More" (Playback) panel — same full-screen issue, plus a feature request

**Screen:** Player screen → "More" pill → Playback panel.

**Problem:** Same full-screen display complaint as Issue 11 (wants smaller +
glass/blur treatment).

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

**Feature request (needs scoping):** User wants more options here beyond
the current four (Playback speed, Sleep timer, Pin to Today, Add to
favorites) — specifics not yet defined. **Needs a follow-up conversation**
before this can be scoped; don't guess at what to add.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-open-items** — the compact More panel now
surfaces the two existing persisted playback settings (smooth transitions
and smart continuation) without inventing unsupported controls, alongside a
dedicated Details tab.

---

## Broader suggestions (not from a specific screenshot — flagging from general review)

These are patterns worth fixing at the system level rather than per-screen,
since the same root causes keep resurfacing:

- **Systemic bottom-clearance bug.** Issues 1b and 2.7 are the same class of
  bug we already fixed once for Library's multi-select bar and the Identify
  screen. A single shared layout constant/hook, audited across *every*
  scrollable screen, would prevent this from recurring a fourth and fifth
  time as new screens get built.

  **Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**
- **No real light theme exists.** Every token in `theme/theme.ts` (`palette`,
  `glass`, `ambient`, `gradients`) is hardcoded dark. If a genuine light mode
  is wanted (Issue 2.3), that's a token-architecture change — a parallel
  light palette selected via a theme context — not a per-component fix. Worth
  scoping as its own project rather than folding into the dashboard modal fix.
- **Reorder-by-drag is a common enough pattern** that adopting a
  battle-tested library (e.g. `react-native-draggable-flatlist`, already
  compatible with the app's Expo/RN version) will likely produce a better
  result with less custom code than hand-rolling arrow buttons with correct
  boundary/disabled states.
- **Motion consistency audit.** The app has a `motion` token (durations/
  easings) but it's unclear how consistently every animated surface
  (modals, tab bar, toasts) actually pulls from it vs. inlining ad hoc
  timings. Worth a quick pass once the dashboard modal animation (2.5) is
  built, so the same values get reused rather than a third set of numbers.
- **Reduced-motion coverage.** `SanctuaryMode` and `Starwell` already check
  `AccessibilityInfo.isReduceMotionEnabled()`. Any new animation added for
  Issues 1 and 2.5 should follow that same guard for consistency.
- **Raw scraped titles keep resurfacing** (Issue 5.3, and the very first
  screenshot's "Continue listening" card). Now confirmed on **three**
  independent surfaces (Home card, Library cards, and Issue 10's broken
  lyrics matching) — this is a `displayTitle`/metadata-cleaning problem, not
  a per-card one, and it's no longer just cosmetic: it's actively breaking
  the lyrics feature (Issue 10). This should be the **highest-priority
  broader fix**, since it has a real functional cost, not just an
  appearance one.
- **"Full-screen takeover for what should be a compact contextual panel" is
  now a confirmed pattern across four separate surfaces:** the dashboard
  customize modal (Issue 2.1), the track options "…" menu (Issue 7), the
  "Up next" panel (Issue 11), and the "More"/Playback panel (Issue 12). Every
  one of these is a small, focused piece of content wrapped in a heavy
  full-height sheet. **Build one shared compact "glass sheet" component**
  (using the frosted-glass surface language already established this
  session) — sized to its content with a sensible max-height, not the full
  viewport — and migrate all four onto it, rather than redesigning each
  one's takeover behavior individually. This is the single highest-leverage
  fix in this whole list: one component change fixes four reported issues.
- **Accent-derived button contrast is a confirmed systemic bug, not three
  separate ones.** `useTrackAccent()` (`hooks/useTrackAccent.ts`) returns a
  raw color sampled from track artwork with no contrast/luminance floor, and
  three different surfaces use it directly as a solid button fill: the mini
  player's play button (first screenshot reviewed), Home's "Continue
  listening" resume button, and the Player screen's main transport button
  (Issue 9.2). For any track with a dark/warm-toned cover, the resulting
  button is nearly invisible. Fix once inside `useTrackAccent` (or a
  wrapper) by clamping the returned color to a minimum contrast ratio
  against the dark surfaces it gets placed on, rather than patching each of
  the three (and any future) call sites individually.

## Issue 15 — Starwell orb (Identify screen) needs a real visual upgrade, tied to the "Star Hollow" name itself

**Screen:** Identify → "What's playing?" (`RecognitionScreen.tsx`, the
`Starwell` component).

**Problem:** Open creative ask — wants the orb to feel significantly more
alive/elaborate, explicitly tied to the app's own name. No concrete
sub-items yet; needs a design direction agreed before implementation.

**Note:** this is the same "make the app's signature visual moments feel
alive" theme as Issue 9 (Player screen) and Issue 14 (Sanctuary ambient
scene) — now a third screen. Worth treating these three as one connected
design pass on the app's key "moments" rather than three unrelated asks.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-open-items**

---

## Issue 16 — 8-second listening window — confirmed exact, easy fix

**Screen:** Identify, while listening.

**Problem:** Confirmed exact — `frontend/src/screens/RecognitionScreen.tsx:35`:
`const LISTEN_SECONDS = 8;`.

**Suggested fix:** Increase this constant. The backend's recognition
timeout (`SMA_RECOGNITION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=25` in `backend/.env`) already
gives plenty of headroom to extend the client-side listening window without
any backend changes — this is a one-line change once fixes start, not a
systems problem.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

---

## Issue 17 — "Recognize sung/hummed lyrics, not just the exact recording" — major feature, needs feasibility research (not a simple fix)

**Screen:** Identify.

**Problem:** User wants recognition to work when a person sings or hums the
melody, not just when the original recording is playing nearby.

**Why this isn't a quick fix:** Confirmed the backend's recognition
(`backend/app/services/recognition/shazam_service.py`) runs through
`shazamio` — the real Shazam API, which works by **acoustic fingerprint
matching** against the exact original studio recording. This technology
fundamentally cannot recognize someone singing or humming a melody — a sung
version has a completely different audio fingerprint than the produced
track, so it will never match, regardless of listening duration (Issue 16
doesn't help this one).

What's being asked for — "hum to search" — is a genuinely different
technology (melody-contour matching, not audio fingerprinting; this is what
Google's "Hum to Search" and SoundHound use). Shazam itself doesn't offer
this.

**Status: needs a research/feasibility pass, not a suggested fix.** Before
this goes in any fix queue, need to determine: is there a usable/affordable
third-party service that supports melody-based recognition we could
integrate, or would this require building melody-matching in-house (a real
ML undertaking, not a config change)? Don't scope implementation work until
that's answered.

## Issue 18 — Activity screen: functionally fine, just needs the same design pass as everything else

**Screen:** Activity (`JobsScreen.tsx`), History list.

**Problem:** No bugs — the History cards (status pill, checkmark, source
badge, "Ready in your library") work correctly as-is. User wants this
screen brought in line with the visual language established by the rest of
this session's edits (frosted-glass surfaces, navy-sky background) rather
than left on the older flat-card style.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

**Note (reinforces an existing issue, not new):** "Take It Off – Kesha
#kesha #lyrics_songs #lyricsedit …" appears here too — the **fourth**
confirmed surface with the raw-scraped-title problem (Home, Library, Issue
10's broken lyrics matching, and now Activity). Further strengthens that as
the top-priority broader fix already flagged above.

## Issue 19 — "Add to playlist" panel — 5th confirmed occurrence of the full-screen-takeover pattern

**Screen:** Library → track "…" menu → "Add to playlist".

**Problem:** Same full-takeover pattern as Issues 2.1, 7, 11, and 12 — a
small, focused piece of content (a text input and a "create playlist"
button) wrapped in a heavy sheet. This is now the **fifth** confirmed
occurrence.

**Suggested fix:** Same as the others — migrate onto the shared compact
glass-sheet component recommended in Broader Suggestions below, once built.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

## Issue 20 — Playlist sheets use a hardcoded off-theme background color — confirmed root cause

**Screens:** "Add to playlist" panel and the Playlist detail view (both
share the same underlying sheet style).

**Problem:** Traced exactly. `frontend/src/components/library/LibrarySheets.tsx:493-495`
— the shared `sheet` style has `backgroundColor: '#1B1426'`, a **literal
hardcoded dark plum/purple hex**, completely disconnected from the theme
tokens (`colors.surface`, `glass.fill`, etc.) used everywhere else in the
app. This is exactly why these two panels visibly clash — a different hue
family entirely — against the navy/forest theme built everywhere else this
session.

**Suggested fix:** Replace `#1B1426` with the appropriate theme token so
these sheets match the rest of the app. Check whether other sheets in this
same file share the `sheet` style — if so, one fix resolves all of them at
once.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion**

**Also reinforces two already-logged issues (not new numbers), both
confirmed again on this screen:**
- Blank/black playlist thumbnails — same root cause as Issue 5.2, now
  confirmed on the playlist card and the playlist-detail track row too.
- Raw scraped title — "Take It Off – Kesha #kesha #lyrics_songs
  #lyricsedit #popmusic" again, now the fifth/sixth confirmed surface.

## Issue 21 — Auto-rename Telegram imports — partially already exists, with real gaps

**Problem (as requested):** files downloaded via Telegram get random
number/letter filenames; wants something to "listen to them" and sort them
into the right category automatically.

**This is not starting from zero.** Found `auto_name_media()` in
`backend/app/workers/job_engine.py:199` — it already runs Shazam
recognition automatically on freshly imported audio with garbage titles.
The code's own comment says: *"Telegram music is the main source of
gibberish names (filename stems)"* — this was built specifically for this
exact problem.

**Confirmed real gaps in the existing implementation:**
1. **Capped at 10 tracks per import batch** (`AUTO_NAME_CAP = 10` in
   `job_engine.py`). Bulk-importing more than 10 from Telegram leaves the
   rest with gibberish names permanently, unless someone manually visits
   Settings → "Name untitled tracks" (which runs the same recognition via
   `POST /recognitions/library`, uncapped, on demand).
2. **Completely skips video files** — the eligibility check explicitly
   requires `media.media_type == AUDIO`. Video imports from Telegram never
   get auto-named at all.
3. **"Sort into the right category" isn't addressed by this at all.** The
   existing feature only fixes display title/artist via Shazam matching —
   there's no playlist/genre/category sorting logic anywhere in the
   codebase. This part is a genuine new feature.
   **Needs scoping before implementation:** what should "category" mean
   here — auto-create/assign genre-based playlists? Sort by media type?
   Something else? Don't guess at this; ask before building it.

**Suggested fix for the confirmed gaps:** raise or remove `AUTO_NAME_CAP`
(or queue the remainder instead of dropping them), and extend eligibility
to cover video-type media too (video recognition would need its own audio
extraction path if `shazam_service` currently assumes an audio file — worth
checking before assuming this is a one-line change).

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-completion** (confirmed gaps only; category
sorting remains unscoped and was not guessed.)

## Issue 22 — Rich track details display — data already exists, needs a real UI for it

**Problem (as requested):** wants song details (release year, artist, etc.)
displayed well and automatically, not just minimally.

**Good news:** the data already exists. `Media` already has `album`,
`genre`, `release_year`, and `is_remix` fields (`backend/app/models/media.py`,
populated from Shazam's metadata on recognition) — but they're currently
only folded into small caption text like "Ambient · 2024" in
`LibraryMediaView.tsx` and `PlayerScreen.tsx`. There's no dedicated "track
details" view presenting this information well.

**Suggested fix:** build a proper details section/panel showing all
available metadata clearly (album, genre, release year, remix flag, source,
etc.) rather than a truncated caption line. **This connects directly to
Issue 12** — the user already asked for "more" content in the Player
screen's "More" panel; a track details section is a natural fit for that
same panel once it's rebuilt as a compact glass sheet.

**Status: fixed in codex/ui-audit-open-items** — the Player's compact More
sheet now has a reusable Details view for artwork, cleaned identity, album,
genre, release year, remix state, duration, source, import date, and available
file facts; missing optional metadata is omitted instead of shown as blanks.

## Deferred (explicitly, per the user)

- **Issue 3.4 (Telegram connection persistence)** — user wants to discuss
  what should happen when connecting to Telegram separately, later. **Do
  not scope or implement changes to Telegram connection/auth flow** until
  that conversation happens.
- **Issue 17 (hum/sing recognition)** — needs a feasibility/research pass
  before any implementation work. Do not attempt to build this from the
  fix list below.

## Suggested working order — completion record

Numeric order was not fix priority. The work was completed in the intended
leverage/risk order:

1. **Confirmed bugs/correctness:** complete.
2. **High-leverage broader fixes:** complete.
3. **Remaining confirmed/scoped issues:** complete, including the bounded
   parts of Issue 21.
4. **Open visual design asks:** complete as one connected Star Hollow
   signature-moments pass.
5. **Intentionally still open:** Issue 2.3's true light-theme architecture,
   Issue 3.3 multi-account support, Issue 5.5's unexplained yellow status dot,
   and Issue 21's category-sorting definition all still require clarification
   or product scoping. Issue 3.4 and Issue 17 remain explicitly deferred.

---

## Status

All confirmed, bounded fixes are complete across `codex/ui-audit-completion`
and `codex/ui-audit-open-items`; each completed entry is marked inline above.
No bounded implementation item was left accidentally open. The only remaining
entries are the four clarification/product-scope items and the two explicitly
deferred items listed in the completion record above. Deferred behavior was
not changed.
