/**
 * Starhollow's visual foundation — forest night under deep space.
 *
 * The canvas is midnight pine: a near-black green-navy that reads as a
 * clearing after dark. Surfaces are solid tonal steps of the same wood.
 * One aurora-teal signal colour carries every action; soft violet is the
 * cosmic counterpoint and star gold appears only as a rare celebratory
 * glint. Decorative gradients and glow are for moments, never hierarchy.
